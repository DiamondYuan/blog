# Hexo Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) site that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example 

To get started with Hexo on Now, you can use the [Hexo CLI](https://hexo.io/docs/index.html#Installation) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ hexo init project-name
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Hexo example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
